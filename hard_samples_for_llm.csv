1701,"4m volcano making kit i bought this kit for my mom and i ( my mom is 60 , i 'm 37 ) and we spent 2 winter evenings building volcanoes . the kit comes in a surprisingly small box , that 's because the volcano mold is made of 4 panels that snap together . the kit includes the 4 volcano panels , a volcano chimney , a small bag of plaster , and watercolor paint . the panels and chimney are made of strong plastic and will not break . it was not a completely trouble free experience , the amount of plaster provided is not quite enough and does not allow for mistakes . sure enough , we made a mistake on the first attempt , we waited too long between mixing the plaster and pouring it in the mold , and ended up with a mess . the solution was to go to the local store to buy a box of plaster of paris , which allowed to make 2 volcanoes without worrying about running out . after pouring the plaster and letting it set , the mold is taken apart to reveal the "" cracked "" surface of the volcano , which looks nice . the chimney remains inside , that 's where the mix of soda and vinegar will go . that means the kit is not intended for making more than one volcano at a time . that was a small problem to address when making the second volcano , i cut out the spout of a water bottle and used it as the chimney for the other volcano . worked well . once both volcanoes have hardened and dried , then came the arts part of the project",18.830116,13: arts_crafts | 53: novelty_gag_toys | 111: sports_outdoor_play | 21: baby_toddler_toys | 31: household_supplies | 145: bathing_skin_care | 3: toys_games | 17: dolls_accessories | 60: tools_accessories | 401: stickers

6294,"mlb series 10 figure be aware that there are two versions of this mlb series 10 figure of rafael palmeiro , who just finished third in the home run hitting contest at the all star game tonight . one shows the future hall of famer in the white jersey of the texas rangers while this updated 6 quot figure has him wearing the black home jersey top of the baltimore orioles , the team he signed with as a free agent for the 2004 season . last year palmeiro made headlines both on and off the field . on the field last year , his 18th season in the majors , he had 38 home runs including his 500th , the 19th player to reach that mark . as of today palmeiro has 539 home runs , which makes him 11th on the all time list ( mike schmidt is waiting at 548 in the 10th spot ) , and 3rd among active players behind bobby bonds and sammy sosa , but still ahead of ken griffey , jr . ( for now ) . palmeiro also made news off the field when he appeared in a series of ads and commercials for viagra as part of a campaign to market the drug to a younger and supposedly virile audience . the player got major props , not just because he was an active major league baseball player following in the footsteps of former senator bob dole to endorse the product , but because he was also a latino ( born in cuba ) talking about a topic that would be considered taboo in a culture whose men pride themselves on machismo . so 2003 was a pretty good year for palmeiro . i have tried to confirm my suspicion that this 6 quot mcfarlane toys figure is based on palmeiro 's run around the bases after hitting his 500th home run last year ( a two out blast off the indians' dave elder on may 11th ) , but aside from confirming that this took place at texas with palmeiro wearing the rangers white jersey i have not been able to do this . but it makes sense palmeiro would not show this sort of emotion while rounding the bases because he is too much of a professional , so i stand by my hunch . so while this orioles version of this figure is correct in terms of the team that palmiero is currently playing , but for fans who do not care what team he is playing with and what to remember he became a member of the 500 home run club , you would want the rangers figure . of course , if you get both of them then you will certainly have yourself covered in terms of having the one that will match up with his hall of fame plaque .",17.988838,53: novelty_gag_toys | 3: toys_games | 111: sports_outdoor_play | 4: games | 15: action_toy_figures | 128: feeding | 105: sexual_wellness | 17: dolls_accessories | 21: baby_toddler_toys | 16: figures
